# Murda-Beatz---Halo-Test
Hi! i'm here to try to explain how to read my code, i tried so hard to be the most clear i could, but maybe, i don't made it... :(
In the case you can't undertand the code a let you here a few hints:
1)i use the BEM Method (mostly). i name the classes following the next "rule"  Block, Element, Modifier or in human lenguaje first the tag which the section are about, second the "category" of the container,
and finally the element.
2)I made some comentaries in the document, telling you where start a section and where end. I did this in the Index.html document and in the Style.css/Responsive.css

while you are reading the code regardless of whether you choose me or not, i'll add the MP3 player and a modal window after push the "Submit" button in the form.
I don't use SCSS because, i prefer, in this case write the code line by line. But i know how to use, i thought "if i use SCSS maybe, can't finish the task on thursday morning", So i use Pure CSS mixing Flex, and Grid.
I use grid in a diferent ways just to show you i can do it, but i prefer the layouts using "grid-template-columns//rows:repeat(x, 1fr).

i used a slider in the video sections showing just one video because in the responsive view the layout which i was recive have some issues when i changed the viewport proportions.
i couldn't change the color of the label in the checkbox so i changed just the color of the font.

thank you so much for the chance, and i wish all of you a great day.
